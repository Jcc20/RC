# IP Protocol

This assignment was divided in two parts: the first focused on IP datagrams and fragmentation, while the latter emphasised addressing and routing.

In order to answer the questions, the team had to monitor IP traffic, resorting either to the program **Wireshark** 
or by building topologies in the **CORE** tool provided by the teachers.

The assignment was developed in **Computer Networks**, in the first semester of the 3rd and last year of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
